     *    This container specifies the shipping rate tables that are to be applied to this listing. Shipping rate tables enable sellers to tailor the flat shipping rates offered for an item to fit the shipping destination. They can specify a shipping rate for a large <em>base</em> region, then define alternative rates or surcharges for shipping to other <em>extended</em> regions within the base region.
     *    <br><br>
     * 
     *    Prerequisites for applying shipping rate tables:
     *    <ul>
     *    <li>The shipping type for the listing must be Flat. </li>
     *    <li>The seller must have previously configured a shipping rate table in My eBay site preferences. </li>
     *    </ul>
     * 
     *                   In a domestic shipping rate table, sellers can specify an alternative shipping rate for each shipping service category, for each of several extended domestic regions within their country. For example, in the US the shipping categories are Economy, Standard, Expedited and One-day. The extended regions are Alaska and Hawaii, US Protectorates, and Army/Fleet Post Offices.
     *    <br><br>
     * 
     *                   In an international shipping rate table, sellers can specify an alternative shipping rate for each shipping service category, for each country in a given base region. The international rate table has nine base regions: Africa, Asia, Central America and Caribbean, Europe, Middle East, North America, Oceania, Southeast Asia, and South America.
     * 
     *          You can use the GetUser call to determine if the seller has configured a shipping rate table. If the domestic shipping rate table is available for this seller, the <strong>User.SellerInfo.DomesticRateTable</strong> field will be <code>true</code>. If the international shipping rate table is available for this seller, the <strong>User.SellerInfo.InternationalTable</strong> field will be <code>true</code>.
     *    <br><br>
     * 
     * <span class="tablenote">
     *    <strong>Note:</strong> You can use <strong>RateTableDetails</strong> to apply a shipping rate table to a listing or remove it from a listing. However, the details of a shipping rate table configuration can only be viewed and modified on the eBay website, not by using the API.
     *    </span>
     * 
     *    Sellers use a dropdown list to specify the alternative shipping rate applied by the rate table as one of the following:
     *    <ul>
     *    <li>A flat amount per item </li>
     *    <li>A flat surcharge (domestic rate tables only) </li>
     *    <li>A surcharge by weight </li>
     *    </ul>
     *

     * 
     *    This container specifies the shipping rate tables that are to be applied to this listing. Shipping rate tables enable sellers to tailor the flat shipping rates offered for an item to fit the shipping destination. They can specify a shipping rate for a large <em>base</em> region, then define alternative rates or surcharges for shipping to other <em>extended</em> regions within the base region.
     *    <br><br>
     * 
     *    Prerequisites for applying shipping rate tables:
     *    <ul>
     *    <li>The shipping type for the listing must be Flat. </li>
     *    <li>The seller must have previously configured a shipping rate table in My eBay site preferences. </li>
     *    </ul>
     * 
     *                   In a domestic shipping rate table, sellers can specify an alternative shipping rate for each shipping service category, for each of several extended domestic regions within their country. For example, in the US the shipping categories are Economy, Standard, Expedited and One-day. The extended regions are Alaska and Hawaii, US Protectorates, and Army/Fleet Post Offices.
     *    <br><br>
     * 
     *                   In an international shipping rate table, sellers can specify an alternative shipping rate for each shipping service category, for each country in a given base region. The international rate table has nine base regions: Africa, Asia, Central America and Caribbean, Europe, Middle East, North America, Oceania, Southeast Asia, and South America.
     * 
     *          You can use the GetUser call to determine if the seller has configured a shipping rate table. If the domestic shipping rate table is available for this seller, the <strong>User.SellerInfo.DomesticRateTable</strong> field will be <code>true</code>. If the international shipping rate table is available for this seller, the <strong>User.SellerInfo.InternationalTable</strong> field will be <code>true</code>.

     * <span class="tablenote">
     *    <strong>Note:</strong> You can use <strong>RateTableDetails</strong> to apply a shipping rate table to a listing or remove it from a listing. However, the details of a shipping rate table configuration can only be viewed and modified on the eBay website, not by using the API.
     *    </span>
     * 
     *    Sellers use a dropdown list to specify the alternative shipping rate applied by the rate table as one of the following:
     *    <ul>
     *    <li>A flat amount per item </li>
     *    <li>A flat surcharge (domestic rate tables only) </li>
     *    <li>A surcharge by weight </li>
     *    </ul>

     *                   This selection applies to the entire table; there is no mixing and matching by region or shipping category.
