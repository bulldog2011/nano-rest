     * <br><br>
     * If the GalleryType value is Gallery, Plus, or Featured, eBay checks the

     * <br>
     * a) Use the URL in GalleryURL, if it is specified.<br>
     * b) Otherwise, if ProductListingDetails.UseStockPhotoURLAsGallery
     * is true, use the eBay stock photo.<br>
     * c) Otherwise, use the value of the first PictureURL in the

     * d) Otherwise, if ProductListingDetails.ProductID is

     * (eBay resets UseStockPhotoURLAsGallery to true in this
     * case).<br>
     * e) If eBay cannot find an image URL for the listing,
     * an error is returned.
     * <br><br>
     * Note that you can use the Gallery Plus feature
     * whether or not the image
     * is hosted with eBay Picture Services (EPS). Selecting Gallery Plus
     * does not incur a separate Gallery fee.
     * <br><br>
     * See "Describing Items in a Listing" in the eBay Web Services
     * Guide for additional information about working with pictures
     * and related validation rules.
     * <br><br>
     * You cannot remove Gallery, Plus, or Featured when revising an item,
     * however you can upgrade to a higher feature. On upgrade, the original
     * feature fee is credited, and the new feature fee is charged.<br>

     * There are a number of categories on some eBay sites that always offer the Gallery

     * add GalleryType=Gallery to the listing (for free) and return a warning (error code
     * 219243). The Knowledge Base explains an edge case that could result in an unexpected
     * gallery fee if the seller moves the item to a category that doesn't offer the free
     * gallery feature. This fee can also appear when if the seller moves the item from a site
     * that offers free Gallery (across all its categories) to one where free Gallery is not
     * yet available. Whenever you change the primary category, it is a good idea to clearly
     * specify whether the seller is intentionally requesting the gallery option.

     * or from an available stock photo. Thus, a Gallery thumbnail

     * apply whenever GalleryType specifies the Plus or Featured image enhancements
     * <b>(there will be no Gallery fee whenever GalleryType is Gallery,
     * None or is not specified in the request)</b>.
     * <br><br>
     * eBay will select the image for the thumbnail depending on which of the image URLs
     * above was specified in the request (there are selection rules for four cases).
     * Note that the selected image will not necessarily be the image you have

     * will not be automatically created if PictureURL and GalleryURL are not supplied and
     * UseStockPhotoURLAsGallery and IncludeStockURL are set to false.
     * <br><br>

     * Contains a URL for a picture associated with an item; cannot be empty or null.
     * The picture may be hosted on eBay Picture Services (EPS). Some options require hosting through EPS.
     * Alternatively, the picture may be self-hosted.
     * eBay determines where the picture is hosted by parsing the value specified in the request.
     * On sites with free gallery,if a listing uses a self-hosted picture
     * (except in the case of a multi-variation listing), the picture will
     * be copied to EPS. The PictureDetails.PictureURL value
     * returned by GetItem will be an EPS URL.
     * See ExternalPictureURL above and see the link below
     * titled "Copy of a Self-Hosted Picture To eBay Picture Services."
     * On a free-Gallery site, if there is a PictureURL, the PictureURL fills in or replaces the GalleryURL.
     * <br><br>
     * <span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b>
     * The following sites have free Gallery: US (site ID 0), the Parts & Accessories
     * Category on US Motors (site ID 100), CA (site ID 2), CAFR (site ID 210),
     * ES (site ID 186), FR (site ID 71), IT (site ID 101),and NL (site ID 146).
     * <br><br>
     * On free-gallery sites, eBay selects a Gallery thumbnail from picture URLs in the
     * request (i.e., either the GalleryURL or the first PictureURL), with selection rules that
     * consider which URLs were specified and whether an eBay stock photo exists
     * for the item. eBay selects a picture regardless of whether you specified
     * GalleryType or GalleryURL. Note that a stock photo is not generated
     * unless the following are true: UseStockPhotoURLAsGallery and IncludeStockPhotoURL.
     * Therefore, an item that does not have a PictureURL may have no Gallery picture.
     * Note that a Gallery fee applies only if you set GalleryType to Plus or Featured (as basic
     * Gallery is free). As a result of these changes, under certain scenarios
     * the picture at the top of a listing may not be the picture you specified in PictureURL.
     * For information about selection rules for the gallery thumbnail on sites with
     * free Gallery, see "Using Gallery Features on Sites with Free Gallery" in the eBay Web
     * Services Guide.</span>
     * <br>
     * To specify multiple pictures, send each URL in a separate, adjacent PictureURL element.
     * In most cases, the picture at the first URL is also used for the picture at the top of
     * a listing.
     * <br>
     * <span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b>
     * If a URI contains spaces, replace them with <code>%20</code>.
     * For example, <code>http://example.com/my image.jpg</code> must be
     * submitted as <code>http://example.com/my%20image.jpg</code> to
     * replace the space in the image file name.
     * </span>
     * <br><br>
     * On the main eBay site, a listing can have up to 12 EPS-hosted pictures, or one
     * self-hosted picture. You cannot mix
     * self-hosted and EPS-hosted pictures in one listing.
     * <br><br>
     * On the US eBay Motors site (for all vehicle listings), and on the eBay Canada site for
     * motors, the picture pack of a listing can contain up to 24 pictures.
     * <br><br>
     * If you embed pictures in the description (with IMG tags) instead of using
     * PictureURL, but you want a camera icon to appear in the search and listing pages, specify
     * the following "clear picture" URL in PictureURL:
     * http://pics.ebay.com/aw/pics/dot_clear.gif.
     * <br><br>
     * <span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b>
     * On free-gallery sites, the camera icon doesn't display as a
     * gallery thumbnail (or on a listing page) when the first PictureURL field in the
     * request is set to the "clear picture" URL;
     * instead, eBay tries to use the
     * picture referenced by GalleryURL as the gallery thumbnail. If GalleryURL has not been
     * specified, a blank (camera-less) gallery thumbnail displays in the search results and
     * at the top of the listing page. If you set the first PictureURL to the "clear
     * picture" URL, you can specify Item.ProductListingDetails.UseStockPhotoURLAsGallery or
     * Item.ProductListingDetails.UseStockPhotoURL to true, and eBay will use a stock photo, if
     * available, for the gallery thumbnail and for the picture at the top of
     * a listing.
     * <br><br>
     * Note that a gallery picture isn't generated if UseStockPhotoURLAsGallery and
     * IncludeStockPhotoURL are set to false (or not set) and no alternative picture is in
     * PictureURL. A Gallery fee applies only if you have specified GalleryType as either Plus
     * or Featured (see Item.PictureDetails.GalleryType above for information). See "Using
     * Gallery Features on Sites with Free Gallery" in the eBay Web Services Guide for
     * information on eBay's selection rules for Gallery pictures on sites with free Gallery.
