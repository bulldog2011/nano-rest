/**
 * 
 *    This type contains fields to specify the shipping rate tables that are to be applied to a listing. Shipping rate tables enable sellers to tailor the flat shipping rates offered for an item to fit the shipping destination. They can specify a base rate for a large region, then define alternative rates or surcharges for shipping to other (extended) regions within the larger region.
 *    <br><br>
 * Prerequisites for applying shipping rate tables:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The shipping type for the listing must be Flat. </li>
 * <li>The seller must have previously configured a shipping rate table in My eBay site preferences. </li>
 * </ul>
 *             This container is returned from the GetItem family of calls only for the seller who listed the item.
 *    <br><br>
 * You can find more information about using shipping rate tables in the Shipping chapter of the Trading API User's Guide.

If only one shipping service category and rate has been set for a given domestic region in the domestic rate table, buyers in that region will see only one shipping cost. If several service levels and rates are set up in the domestic shipping rate table for a given domestic region, buyers in that region will see the different shipping levels and rates and can choose one of them.
