     * public getter
     *
     * 
     * Enables you (the seller) to avoid being left with 1 item in your 
     * listing. A typical use case is event tickets in reserved, 
     * adjacent seats, or items that typically only sell if more than 
     * 1 can be purchased at once. <br>
     * <br>
     * Specify the minimum number of items that 
     * should remain if a buyer doesn't purchase all the items. 
     * Based on the value of MinimumRemnantSet and the listing's 
     * available quantity (Quantity-QuantitySold), eBay calculates how many 
     * items a buyer can purchase. 
     * For example, suppose you list 5 tickets, and you want at least 
     * 2 tickets remaining for the final buyer to purchase. 
     * In this case, you would set MinimumRemnantSet to 2. 
     * This means a buyer can purchase 1, 2, 3, or 5 tickets, but not 4 
     * (because 4 would leave the seller with 1 ticket).<br>
     * <br>
     * To remove this restriction when you revise or relist,
     * set MinimumRemnantSet to 1.<br>
     * <br>
     * Applicable to multi-quantity, fixed-price listings. 
     * Currently supported for US and CA event ticket listings.
